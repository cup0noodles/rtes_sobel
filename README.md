# Image Viewer
### CPE 442 Project
### Matthew Wong - W24

This project documents the running development of a Sobel filter using the OpenCV library throughout the course of CPE 442.

Usage: `./imgview file_name thread_count debug_code (optional)`

## Test Files
There are two primary test files used - video1 and RoTS-Opening. video1 is relatively small, 400x600 PAL format, while RoTS-Opening is a longer, HD video.

# Lab Development

## Lab 1 - Image Viewer
- Basic image file access

## Lab 2 - Video Viewer
- Basic video playback

## Lab 3 - Sobel filter
- Implimentation of Sobel filter and grayscale conversion

## Lab 4 - Multithreading
- Implimentation of variable multithreading.
- Implimentation of time based performance metric to better quantify improvements.
